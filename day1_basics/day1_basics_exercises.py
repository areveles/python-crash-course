''' 
1. Create two variables: x = 8 and y = 3, and print the sum, difference, product, and quotient
2. Ask the user for their name and favorite color, then print a sentence that says:
"Hi [name]! Your favorite color is [color]"
3. Ask the user for two numbers and print their product
4. Write a program that calculates the remainder when dividing one number by another
'''
# Exercise 1: Sum, difference, product, quotient
x = 8
y = 3
print( x + y)
print(x - y)
print(x * y)
print(x / y)

# Exercise 2: Name and color
name = input("Please enter your name: \n")
color = input("Please enter your favorite color: \n")
print(f'Hi {name}! Your favorite color is {color}')

# Exercise 3: Product of two numbers
# (your code here)

# Exercise 4: Remainder
